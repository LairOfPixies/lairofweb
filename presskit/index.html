		Indie games from Berlin.
	</p>
							<h2 id="history">History</h2><strong>Beginnings</strong>
<p>
				Making your own games seemed an impossible dream not too long ago.  
Back in the times when I was an engineering student, it looked like the 
only possible route was through an industry with a reputation of a high 
burnout rate, getting hired by a big software house where the 
programmer's role is that of a cog in a machine, working overtime as 
part of a team of more than 50 people where the chances of making any 
sort of impact on the final design of a game were close to zero.  My own
 interest was rather in the creative side of programming, and I started a
 career on a different field, focused on research.
</p><p>
				Around 2007 "Indie games" started to become popular.  Little pieces 
of software made by small teams where the focus is on the love of their 
creators for the medium, instead of an obsession for financial outcome. 
 Making games was fun again, and even possible, thanks to digital 
distribution and better, simpler tools.  This reignited my interest in 
videogames.  I started playing them again.  Moreover, I already had more
 than a decade of experience as a C++ developer, half of it 
professionally.  I did have the skills, now I had the chance.
</p><p>
				But I didn't have the time. Already busy with a day job in a 
different industry, my free time was insufficient. Moreover, being able 
to start and finish such a project on your own is very different to 
working as part of a team in a big company.  The programmer in me was 
getting sidetracked by the temptation to write complex, generic systems 
which we call "engines", instead of focusing on the "game" part of 
games.  My creative side would dream ambitious, sprawling game concepts 
that are not doable in a reasonable time by a one-man team working in 
his free time from his bedroom.  Several failed attempts lead me to 
abandon the idea of making games, once again.

</p><strong>BIGjam</strong>
<p>
			On Summer 2009 I moved to Berlin. It coincided with the BIGjam.  It 
was a meet-up of indie game developers from around Europe.  Without 
knowing anyone, not even participating in the forum where they had met 
each other, TIGsource, I still decided to show up and ask them if it was
 ok for me to sit on a corner and watch them work.  They welcomed me 
with open arms and made me feel part of their community since the moment
 I stepped in.  The jam was 3 days long, composed of several 
mini-projects where you would make a game in 3 hours.  The second day I 
brought my laptop and started making games with them.
</p><p>
			I made 3 games that weekend.  Those were not very good games, but it 
was the first time I was able to finish something outside of my 
workplace.
</p><p>
			This inspired me so much that I started a new game that I finished 
roughly a month later, called "GunFu Deadlands".  My first "real" game. I
 posted it online, and it caught the interest of some people.  At the 
time of this writing it's been downloaded more than 10,000 times, I have
 received mails from fans praising the game, and it was featured on 
several websites, videos and even a book: "250 Indie Games you must 
play" by Mike Rose.
</p><p>
			I started a new job, still not in the games industry, and I also 
started a new game project on the side.  It was more ambitious than 
GunFu Deadlands, and I already had noticed some performance problems 
with GunFu, so the first task would be to write a proper game engine 
that would solve that. It was a disaster.  Since I was doing it on my 
free time this meant that I couldn't put much time in it, and the 
project slugged through weeks and months without any progress.  Another 
big failure, I had just repeated the same mistake from former years, one
 more time.
</p><strong>Berlin Mini Jam</strong>
<p>
			The next BIGjam took place on summer 2010.  Another inspiring meetup,
 another couple of games made. I was getting so much from this event, 
but then the rest of the year I wasn't able to do anything productive, 
when it comes to games.  I wanted it to happen more often.I had the luck
 to meet Tobias Wehrum at the BIGjam.  He lives in Berlin.  I also knew 
Iwan Gabovitch, another Berliner, from the BIGjam the year before.  I 
pitched the idea of more regular jams to Tobias, and he liked that, and 
this is how the Berlin Minijam was born.  The "not-BIG" jam. Iwan joined
 as the third member shortly after.
</p><p>
			In 2014, we've already organized more than 40 jams, some of them as 
part of bigger events.We've coorganized other meetups and events in 
collaboration with other organizations. We have a nice and healthy local
 community of people interested in the process of making games, 
including students, independent freelancers, game companies, and other 
contacts from the start-up scene in Berlin.  One thousand members in our
 Facebook group. There's even an indie games festival taking place in 
Berlin, the Amaze.  Though not organized by us, we feel that we're part 
of it as well.
</p><strong>Lair of pixies</strong>
<p>
			Through the various game jams I've attended or organized, I've been 
able to make a lot of games myself.  Small, non-ambitious, but something
 I am still proud of.  More than 20 finished games are on display in my 
blog, "Just for fun", all free to download and play.  It's been a great 
learning experience, I can say that jams have changed my life.
</p><p>
			The idea behind Lair of Pixies is to take some of the games I make in
 jams, the little 5-minute-gameplay experiments, and add a bit of 
polishing.  Transform them into marketable products that can be enjoyed 
for larger periods.  Choose among the games I've published in my blog 
and the ones that never escaped my hard disk, and spend a couple of 
months polishing the most interesting ones.
</p><p>
			I resist to call Lair of Pixies it a "game studio" or a "game 
company", but I guess that's what it is.  It's the name under which I 
will publish the polished versions of some of my games. "Just for Fun" will remain a place for 
jam-games only, a porfolio of the "unpolished" and "discarded" versions.
  For a day job, I am still working as a freelance software developer 
for other clients, which lets me work part-time and bring in some cash 
to pay my bills, while at the same leaving enough free time so that I 
can work on growing up a Lair of Pixies portfolio.
